		   <p>Near the end of my two years living in New Orleans, record-breaking floods devastated Louisinana. My friend, Virginia Hanusik, has been studied and photographed water on the gulf coast in its many forms. The picture above and te note below are hers:</p>
		   <p>"I'm known to many friends and colleagues as the "water girl". My professional and creative lives are both deeply entrenched in understanding the role water has in shaping our world, and I am forever indebted to Louisiana - its people, landscape, culture, and weather - for being the microcosm of our environmental future.</p>
		   <p>This flooding means something. Despite the lack of media attention or the fact that Louisiana has had 63 major disaster declarations since 1953 (once every year since then), this particular event explicitly highlights the position we have put ourselves in as it relates to environmental vulnerability...</p>
		   <p>If you are looking to help, but are hindered by distance, please consider donating to this trusted organization, <a href="http://foundationforlouisiana.org">Foundation for Louisiana</a>, which is collecting donations to directly assist in flood assistance - both immediate and long-term."</p>
